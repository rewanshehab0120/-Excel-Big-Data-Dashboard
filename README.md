# 📊 Excel Big Data Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I handled **8.5+ million rows** of sales data entirely inside Microsoft Excel, without migrating to SQL or Power BI.

Instead of relying on traditional worksheets, I leveraged **Data Model and Power Pivot** to build a structured, scalable analytical solution.
